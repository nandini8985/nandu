% Define constants
k = 1;  % You can modify this constant based on your requirement
L = 1;  % Characteristic length scale

% Define symbolic variables for x (position) and t (time)
syms x t

% Define the correct density function rho as a function of x and t
rho = k * t * exp(-x/L);  % Corrected density function with k * t

% Velocity field u along the x-axis
u = L/t;  % Given in the problem

% Compute the local time derivative of rho (d(rho)/dt)
drho_dt = diff(rho, t);

% Compute the spatial derivative of rho (d(rho)/dx)
drho_dx = diff(rho, x);

% Compute the material derivative D(rho)/Dt
material_derivative = drho_dt + u * drho_dx;

% Simplify the result of the material derivative
material_derivative_simplified = simplify(material_derivative);

% Display the result of the material derivative

% Now let's compute how the density changes over a range of positions and times
% Define time and position vectors
time = linspace(1, 10, 100);  % Time from 1 to 10
position = linspace(0, 10, 100);  % Position from 0 to 10

% Preallocate a matrix for density values
rho_values = zeros(length(time), length(position));

% Calculate density for each time and position
for i = 1:length(time)
    for j = 1:length(position)
        % Substitute numerical values into the symbolic expression for rho
        rho_values(i, j) = double(subs(rho, {x, t}, {position(j), time(i)}));
    end
